Rivet analyses for JEWEL with realistic hydrodynamics

All analyses are written for JEWEL's custom version of Rivet 3 with the Constituent Subtraction methodology (see https://jewel.hepforge.org/subtraction.html). 

They were intended for JEWEL coupled with realistic hydro, but they will work for out-of-the-box JEWEL as well. For other MC generators, check and modify the uses of *SubtractedJewelEvent* and *SubtractedJewelFinalState* projections.
